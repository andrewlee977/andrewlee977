I'm a Data Scientist who is passionate about end-to-end data driven applications that solve user and business problems. Currently looking for opportunities in Data Science and Data Engineering!

üìä  My most recent project was with the [Human Rights First](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/human-rights-first-asylum-ds-a) organization to improve data accessibility and outcomes in refugee asylum cases. Our product will help lawyers win refugee asylum cases by providing analytics to help build stronger cases.

üéì  I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration ‚Äì Operations & Business Analytics (Major) and Computer Information Technology (Minor), with Honors distinction, at University of Oregon (Graduated June 2020)

üìö  I recently graduated from Lambda School's Data Science program (Graduated August 2021)

üèí  Fun Fact: I played collegiate ice hockey and won the PAC-8 tournament my senior year! We beat San Jose State, Arizona State, and Boise State to clinch the title
