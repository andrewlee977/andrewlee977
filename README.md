### Hi there üëã

<!--
**andrewlee977/andrewlee977** is a ‚ú® _special_ ‚ú® repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

I'm a graduate of the University of Oregon ‚Äì Charles H. Lundquist College of Business, where I studied in the Business Honors Program. I majored in Business Administration ‚Äì Operations & Business Analytics and minored in Computer Information Technology. I have previous experience in Sales, Business Development, Finance, and Analytics, so I implement these experiences with my technical background.

I'm currently looking for an opportunity to apply my business and technical backgrounds to continue building end-to-end data driven applications that solve business problems. I want to build applications that scale. This is my passion.

üìö  I graduated from the Data Science program at Bloom Institute of Technology (formerly Lambda School) in August 2021

üèí  Fun Fact: I played collegiate ice hockey and won the PAC-8 tournament my senior year! We beat San Jose State, Arizona State, and Boise State to clinch the title
